# Practice-Game
Just for my shitty text based game
This is just a practice game with no real literary or entertainment value.
I'm just screwing around with coding, but maybe I can do something fun with this eventually! So yeah.
It works pretty simply. If there are no options presented but a chunk of text has been provided, hit enter.
Otherwise, enter the letter of whatever you wanna do.
I've just added stats but I'm looking for a way to have them always accessible. I'm still pretty new to this haha.
Sorry for the messy code. I'll clean it up eventually. There's probably a better way to do this than millions of if else statements I just haven't found it yet.
Eventually I'm going implement math.random for dice rolls and such but I haven't gotten to that point.
I have two storylines planned out so far. I plan to have more than two but I need to finish these two first!
I hope you enjoy it :-).
